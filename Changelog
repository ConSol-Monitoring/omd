This file documents the revision history for the Open Monitoring Distribution

1.30 (next, not yet released)
          - omd:
            - Added "Basic / ADMIN_MAIL" hook to configure the target mail
              address for eMails sent to the site user (e.g. created by
              crontab). Finally this generates the ~/.forward file within
              the sites directory. When a mail address is configured, the
              file is written, when you have none configured, the file is
              deleted.
              If you already have a ~/.forward file, the mail address will
              automatically be used as ADMIN_MAIL value.
            - Added backup/restore modes to backup and restore sites completely
              You can backup your sites and restore them with the same or a
              different name.

              Example:
                omd backup mysite /tmp/backup.tgz

              And for restore use:
                omd restore restored /tmp/backup.tgz

              You need to ensure you have the OMD version installed during
              restore, which the site was using during backup.

              You can also backup to stdout and restore from stdin which means
              you can stream a backup cross the network. This might not only
              be useful for backups, but also for migrations across servers.
            - FIX: Update mechanism detects obsolete but non empty directories
              correctly and asks the user whether or not to delete them
            - FIX: SLES omd init-Script does not use default runlevel 4 anymore
            - FIX: Added PYTHONPATH to site crontab for being able to access
              the sites python modules as when run in interactive mdoe
          - NagVis:
            - Update to version 1.8.5
            - Removed deprecated directory var/nagvis/userfiles. This was
              deprecated since version 0.52. During the update to 1.30, the
              directory and all its contents will be removed. This should be
              no problem for most users, because the directory is not used
              anymore since a long time.
              If you update from OMD 0.52 or below, you need to manually backup
              files from var/nagvis/userfiles and copy them to
              local/share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles after the update to make them
              available again.
              Note: If you decide to downgrade from this or a following
              version to version 0.52 or older, you will again need to care
              about these files manually.
            - FIX: The nagvis URLs were not correctly linking to e.g. Check_MK
              when a site has been created with Check_MK as default GUI
            - FIX: Fixed site not starting after "omd cp" when using 
              the arguments --no-past, --no-rrds or --no-logs
          - Check_MK:
            - Update to 1.2.6p5
            - moved log dir to var/log
          - Added build support for SLES 12
          - Added build support for Ubuntu 14.10 and 15.04
          - Added build support for Debian 8
          - RedHat / CentOS: Builds are now only dedicated to the major
            version, not caring about the minor versions anymore

            - mod_fcgid: update to 2.3.9, sles 11 and centos 5/6 only
            - set graceful restart timeout
            - Default redirects from /[site] and /[site]/ to /[site]/omd/ are
              are now preserving the original requested protocol (http/https).
              When using the apache shared mode (which is the default), having
              the system apache service the pages via HTTPS, you will need to
              configure the system apache to provide the X-Forwarded-Proto
              request header to the site apache, which can be done by
              adding the line 'RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"' to
              the proxy configuration related to the site.
          - Dokuwiki
            - Updated to Version 2014-09-29d
            - fix discarding all local settings on update

1.20     Aug 25 2014
          - apache: Changed order of apache daemon startup/stopping
            The webserver is now started after the monitoring core, but more
            important, it is now stopped after the core. This should reduce
            the time needed to bring down all worker processes, since there
            are no hanging livestatus connections started by web clients anymore.

          - Switch Check_MK to version 1.1.12p6 (Please refer to the migration notes
            of Check_MK on http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_migration_notes.html!)
          - FIX: WATO - Fixed permissions on conf.d directory for shared apache mode
          - FIX: Fixed permissions for PHP temp files in shared mode
          - Get rid of dummy host in a plain fresh OMD site
          - NagVis
            - Updated to NagVis 1.6.1
              Note #1: The userfiles directory has been moved from var/nagvis/userfiles
              to local/share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles. The side individual files
              shal be copied during update. The old files are left untouched in the
              old directory. If everything works as expeced after update and you
              don't plan to downgrade again you can savely remove the directory
              var/nagvis/userfiles from your site
              Note #2: During "omd update" omd might tell you that the file etc/nagvis/auth.db
              is obsolete and you changed its contents. In normal cases you want to keep the
              file (press k) to keep your user accounts, role assignments and permissions.
            - local/ hierarchie can now handle .php files
            - Moved nagvis-omd.ini.php to new conf.d/ directory
          - OMD
            - Added 'umount' option to unmount the ramdisk of a site

            - Handling comments and empty lines in .info files correcty 
            - Made 'setversion' work on broken links
            - New commands 'disable' and 'enable'. OMD does not depend on the
              home directories of disabled sites. This is useful in cluster environments.
            - New option 'omd create --disabled' and 'omd init' which allows the creation
              of a site with an empty home directory and afterwards population it. Again
              this supports cluster environments.
            - start, restart and reload now honor the option -f,--force: All
              sites will then be affected, regardless of AUTOSTART
            - FIX: omd update: page diff through less -F -X (-X is new). This fixes
              a problem where the diff is not visible on dumb terminals like PuTTY.
            - FIX: omd: site processes where missing supplementary groups when starting
              the site as root via 'omd start SITE'
            - FIX: omd update handled most files twice (without need). This is
              fixed now.
            - FIX: omd diff now correctly handles relative paths.
            - FIX: omd diff now correctly instantiates templates before showing
              diff in verboes mode

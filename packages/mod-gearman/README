gearman_proxy.pl
=================

Proxy Gearman Jobs from one jobserver to another jobserver. This could
be handy, when you have a worker in a remote net and only push is
allowed.

Mod-Gearman <-> Gearmand <-> Gearman-Proxy <--|--> Gearmand <-> Worker

Instead of the Worker polling from the master gearmand, it can now
poll the jobs from a local jobserver which gets fed by the
Gearman-Proxy.

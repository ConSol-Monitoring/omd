# Alias: Mod-Gearman
# Menu: Distributed Monitoring
# Description:
#  Here you can enable/disable distributed features based on Gearman.
#  Using Mod-Gearman will reduce the latency and load caused by check execution -
#  even when used on the same host - because the Mod-Gearman worker
#  is smaller and more efficient in the creation of processes than Nagios.

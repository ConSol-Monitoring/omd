# Tuning settings for the rrdcached. Please refer to rrdcached(1) for
# details. After changing something here, you have to do a restart
# of the rrdcached (reload is not sufficient)

# Data is written to disk every TIMEOUT seconds. If this option is
# not specified the default interval of 300 seconds will be used.
TIMEOUT=3600

# rrdcached will delay writing of each RRD for a random
# number of seconds in the range [0,delay).  This will avoid too many
# writes being queued simultaneously.  This value should be no
# greater than the value specified in TIMEOUT. 
RANDOM_DELAY=1800

# Every FLUSH_TIMEOUT seconds the entire cache is searched for old values
# which are written to disk. This only concerns files to which
# updates have stopped, so setting this to a high value, such as
# 3600 seconds, is acceptable in most cases. 
FLUSH_TIMEOUT=7200

# Specifies the number of threads used for writing RRD files. Increasing this
# number will allow rrdcached to have more simultaneous I/O requests into the
# kernel. This may allow the kernel to re-order disk writes, resulting in better
# disk throughput.
WRITE_THREADS=4

OMD contains a lot of open source software. The licensing and copyright
of each package be found in
/opt/omd/versions/default/usr/share/doc/<package-name>

The program omd was initially written by Mathias Kettner <mk@mathias-kettner.de>,
who also had the initial idea and concept of the whole OpenSource Monitoring
Distribution. Many others have helped.

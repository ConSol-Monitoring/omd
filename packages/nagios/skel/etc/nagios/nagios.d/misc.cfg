# CHECK FOR UPDATES
# This option determines whether Nagios will automatically check to
# see if new updates (releases) are available.  It is recommend that you
# enable this option to ensure that you stay on top of the latest critical
# patches to Nagios.  Nagios is critical to you - make sure you keep it in
# good shape.  Nagios will check once a day for new updates. Data collected
# by Nagios Enterprises from the update check is processed in accordance 
# with our privacy policy - see http://api.nagios.org for details.

check_for_updates=0

# BARE UPDATE CHECK
# This option deterines what data Nagios will send to api.nagios.org when
# it checks for updates.  By default, Nagios will send information on the 
# current version of Nagios you have installed, as well as an indicator as
# to whether this was a new installation or not.  Nagios Enterprises uses
# this data to determine the number of users running specific version of 
# Nagios.  Enable this option if you do not want this information to be sent.

# DATE FORMAT OPTION
# This option determines how short dates are displayed. Valid options
# include:
#       us              (MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
#       euro            (DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
#       iso8601         (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
#       strict-iso8601  (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)

# REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING
# This option controls whether or not regular expression matching
# takes place in the object config files.  Regular expression
# matching is used to match host, hostgroup, service, and service
# group names/descriptions in some fields of various object types.
# Values: 1 = enable regexp matching, 0 = disable regexp matching

use_regexp_matching=0

# "TRUE" REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING
# This option controls whether or not "true" regular expression 
# matching takes place in the object config files.  This option
# only has an effect if regular expression matching is enabled
# (see above).  If this option is DISABLED, regular expression
# matching only occurs if a string contains wildcard characters
# (* and ?).  If the option is ENABLED, regexp matching occurs
# all the time (which can be annoying).
# Values: 1 = enable true matching, 0 = disable true matching

# OMD does compile in embedded perl but disables it per
# default. So everyone should be fine.
# Only enable this when you really know what you are doing.
# Embedded perl can cause memory leaks and make Nagios
# instable if not properly used.

enable_embedded_perl=0

# EMBEDDED PERL USAGE OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will process Perl plugins
# and scripts with the embedded Perl interpreter if the plugins/scripts
# do not explicitly indicate whether or not it is okay to do so. Read
# the HTML documentation on the embedded Perl interpreter for more 
# information on how this option works.

# ILLEGAL OBJECT NAME CHARACTERS
# This option allows you to specify illegal characters that cannot
# be used in host names, service descriptions, or names of other
# object types.

illegal_object_name_chars=`~!$%^&*|'"<>?,()=

# ILLEGAL MACRO OUTPUT CHARACTERS
# This option allows you to specify illegal characters that are
# stripped from macros before being used in notifications, event
# handlers, etc.  This DOES NOT affect macros used in service or
# host check commands.
# The following macros are stripped of the characters you specify:
#       $HOSTOUTPUT$
#       $HOSTPERFDATA$
#       $HOSTACKAUTHOR$
#       $HOSTACKCOMMENT$
#       $SERVICEOUTPUT$

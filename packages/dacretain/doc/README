dacretain
=========

dac is an acronym for downtimes, acknowledgements and comments.

It enabled it saves all this objects into an SQLite database just
before naemon is stopped or reloaded. If services or hosts with
downtimes, acks or comments are missing they will retain in the
SQLite database for 24h.

If the host or services come back, the acknowledgements, comments
and downtimes will be restored.

This is useful if your config generation is not so reliable. If you
loose hosts or services by accident dacs are restored from the
database.
